  Part of any major life shift is to make it stick.  Major habits can be
  hard to change, and hard things are hard to do, and we often have few
  tools to help us make these changes.  Willpower is often quoted, but
  frequently fails.  Willpower is also HARD.  
** CFAR
   [[http://rationality.org][The Center for Applied Rationality]] Puts on a workshop that teachs you
   scientific approaches to improving the rationality in your life.  What 
   is rationality?  There is a number of things:
   - Reason better using statistical thinking (Bayes theorem)
   - Harness your "System 1" or intuitive or fast part of your brain
   - Do the things you want to do but aren't doing
   - Make or break habits WITHOUT using willpower
   - Use your emotions to help you, and diminish bad emotions.
