How to be a Better Programmer
=============================

Introduction
------------

This is a guide on how to be a better programmer.  This README only helps you read it.


The Guide
---------

The guide is written in a text file using ["org mode"](http://orgmode.org).  Org mode an 
emacs plugin, and part of being a good programmer is knowing emacs.  So by reading, and maybe
contributing you can practice being a better programmer!

If you can't/won't emacs, it's ok, the guide is still just plain text and reads easily, even on
github.

Forking
-------

Any written document is by definition incomplete.  In the past future revisions would 
need printing, but in a new era of programming, you can FORK it, and PATCH it and 
send a PULL request.  Thus you are learning github, open-source contribution, and
workflow and are also learning or practicing to be a better programmer.
